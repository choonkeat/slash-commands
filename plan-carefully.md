$ARGUMENTS

Let's develop a detailed plan.

First, give me the high level goal and phases of implementation. Ask me if I'm ok with that.

Then for each phase listed above,
1. Describe what will be achieved
2. Describe all the small steps that will be taken
3. Elaborate on how we'll verify it works and how we'll guarantee we did not introduce regression (TDD style red green refactor is preferred)
4. Ask me if I'm ok with that

Once we've done that for every phase listed above
1. write the entire plan into ./tasks/{yyyy-mm-dd in local time}-{task}.md 
2. ask me if we are ok to proceed implementing it.
